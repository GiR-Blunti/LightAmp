# XIVAmp
It's just An other MIDI Player.

This is a fun project to create a MIDI player for XIV. It's based on the published BMP2.0 libraries and made with the help of the Bards of Light community.

It's using two Ui layouts, the old well known classic BMP and a WinAmp one. The WinAmp Ui is skinnable with the classic WinAmp skins.


Feel free to use, modify or fork it.
